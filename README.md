Hi I'm Gibelly, I'm from Ephrata Washington and currently attending EWU studying Design and Film. I decided to make my Final website a protfolio of my work from the 2023-24 school year.

## Content
My website is a showcase of my creative work, featuring work in typography, social media posts and print. You'll find a biography and a detailed explantation of my skills, as well as link to other socials. The vibe is modern and stylish, making it easy to see my skills and service.

## CSS Styling
* I went with a modern and simple CSS styling. It uses a minimal layout with 2 columns of content, showcasing a combination of white space and bold typography. 
* The color palette is a pink toned white with a deep brown text color, allowing the content to stand out.
* The images are layed out in a grid with a subtle drop shadow to add depth. 
* The overall design is responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across different devices.
